# Background Music Mod
### by timnxx20

Adds randomly playing background music to Minetest. The timing between tracks and
various other settings can be changed in the Minetest advanced settings menu.
Different music can be added relatively easily by editing "init.lua" - the
code is commented so it shouldn't be difficult to customise it to your liking.

The included tracks are taken from the album "Resolute" by "Blue Dot Sessions"
and are released under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license.
